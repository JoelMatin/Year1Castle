# Year1Castle
Hello reader,

This project was done in collaboration with student Noémi Mertens for the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the context of the first year course INFO-H100 - Informatique - 202021 under the teaching Thierry Massart.

The goal of the project was to make a maze like game where the main character has to go through boxes where he will get clues about riddles he needs to answer in other boxes aswell as to assemble the map of the maze which will allow him to get out quicker. 

Enjoy !
